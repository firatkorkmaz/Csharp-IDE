# C-Sharp IDE
A lightweight IDE for C# console applications, written in C#.

## General Information
This project consists of 4 different programs which can be considered as steps for approaching to the final program:
1. **TextEditor**: The 1st and simple text editor program which can read contents of text files and saves any changes back in the opened files.
2. **CsharpEditor**: The 2nd program is a text editor with C# compiler, which has one single textbox to write all the necessary codes in it, in order to create C# console applications. 
3. **CsharpCompiler**: The 3rd program is similar to the 2nd one with one additional textbox for external classes, so that the main code does not take too long. 
4. **CsharpIDE**: The 4th program is the final IDE program with two additional textboxes for external classes, so that the class codes may not take too long. There are also options for saving each textbox individually as (.cs) files so that the full project can be extracted from the IDE.\
* All the programs except the 1st one include embedded demo codes in their textboxes for testing the programs quickly and having ready structures to write personal codes easily.

## Technologies

* Microsoft Visual Studio
